# React example of a Social Media Feed App

This repo contains an example of a Social Media Feed App, it's a simple one, mostly UI, not so much functionality. The focus is on creating components and working with props.

There are two branches. The `main` branch contains the completed application and the `dev-start` branch contains the starting version of the application with just all the assets, css and the shell of the app set up.
